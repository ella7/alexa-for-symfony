# alexa-for-symfony
A PHP library to handle request and responses to/from an Amazon Alexa Skill. 
The library is designed to work well with Symfony projects, although it could also be used outside of Symfony. 

This project is currently very much a work in progress. If anyone is interested in helping out, please let me know.
